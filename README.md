### Bayesian Changepoint Model
The Bayesian Changepoints model scores changepoint probability in a univariate sequential dataset, usually a time series.

**Changepoint:** Changepoints are abrupt changes in the mean or variance of a time series. For instance, during an economic recession, stock values might suddenly drop to a very low value. The time at which the stock value dropped is called a changepoint.

The Bayesian Changepoints model has two variants:
1. Bayesian Offline Changepoint Detection [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.3099.pdf]
2. Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3742v1.pdf]
